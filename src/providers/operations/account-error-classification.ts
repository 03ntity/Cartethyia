/**
 * Account error classification: turns one upstream failure into a category,
 * a cooldown window, and a verdict on the account.
 *
 * This is the decision half of the account health machine. It is pure: it
 * reads evidence and returns a classification, writes nothing, and knows
 * nothing about the database. The writer half lives in
 * `account-health-service.ts`.
 *
 * The shared types and pure helpers live in `account-error-contracts.ts`, the
 * evidence/context builder in `account-error-evidence.ts`, and the ordered
 * rule arms in `provider-rules/*` — this file keeps only the signal assembly
 * and the rule table, and re-exports the public surface so existing importers
 * are unchanged.
