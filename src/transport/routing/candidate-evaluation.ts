/**
 * Shared eligibility evaluator used by live routing, console diagnostics,

 *
 * A cooling account is *deprioritized*, not excluded. Cooling means "recently
 * failed, try something else first", not "cannot serve this request": a quota
 * cooldown is usually scoped to one model or one provider, the deadline can be
 * the classifier's own fallback rather than the provider's statement, and a
 * per-request refusal (a bid the upstream declined) can park an otherwise
 * healthy account for an hour. Excluding it made the gateway answer
 * `accounts_unavailable` while a usable credential sat idle — reported as
 * "cooldown blocks the account completely". Ordering is what carries the
 * intent instead: `plan()` sorts cooling candidates after every healthy one,
 * so they are reached only when nothing better is left.
 *
 * That ordering only helps while a healthy sibling exists. Once *every* eligible
 * candidate is cooling there is nothing to fail over to, and dialing a cooling
 * account can only reproduce the refusal that cooled it — the operator's "still
 * hit a cooled-down account, never failed over" report. `plan()` therefore
 * answers `accountsRateLimitedError` (429) in that end state instead of
 * planning a cooling account; the evaluator itself still returns `cooldown`
 * candidates eligible, because the ordering above is what the plan needs to
 * build the healthy-first list.
 *
 * `model_cooldown` reaches that same 429 by a different route: the evaluator
 * excludes it outright, so when it is the only reason nothing is eligible
 * `plan()` reports it as a time-bounded refusal rather than 503
 * `accounts_unavailable`. See the branch in `plan()`.
 *
 * `model_cooldown` is the exception, and a hard exclusion. It is the snapshot's
 * marker for an *unexpired per-model* entry on the candidate whose model is
 * being planned — the upstream stated this exact (account, model) pair is
 * exhausted until a named reset. That is a verdict about this request, not a
 * general "try later": the deadline is the provider's own statement, retrying
 * inside it can only reproduce the refusal, and the account keeps serving every
 * other model it holds. Deprioritizing it instead made failover burn a full
 * round trip on a known-refused account after every healthy sibling failed, and
 * logged a fresh `active → cooldown` row on each attempt.
 *
 * `disabled` stays a hard exclusion: it is an operator decision, and only an
 * operator restores it.
